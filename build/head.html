          <p>I couldn’t take any more about the tannin and the finish and the nose while there was still a third of the bottle unpoured. My coworkers nodded along as the lady droned and the remainder of the bottle taunted me, but I put my glass by the sink and left to get drunk.</p>
          <p>There’s a bar I like on East Passyunk where you can still   smoke inside and the jukebox doesn’t suck. I like it primarily because it’s directly across the street from my house. It’s easy to stick around until I’m on the brink of passing out and then float home more or less instantly, whether I’m alone or there happened to be a desperate-enough dude under 40 getting loaded on the barstool next to me that night. I’m not, as you can probably tell, very particular.</p>
          <p>The wine tasting was on a Tuesday which meant I wanted to keep it minimal with the citywides, skipping the shot every other round. Only regulars came in this early in the week, so I was thinking I’d be on my own when I was finally drunk enough to hit the mattress on the floor across the street, but on my third round Alex popped up next to me. He was my age, attractive, and single enough.</p>
          <p>“Happy birthday,” said the bartender.</p>
          <p>Alex ordered a citywide and the old man shuffled off to collect the components. It wasn’t Alex’s birthday—the bartender said that to everyone since his stroke.</p>
          <p>“What are you reading,” I said.</p>
          <p>“A novel. It’s okay,” he said. I glanced at the book. NYRB. Something fancy. Alex only read fancy things. I liked that about him. I stopped skipping shots.</p>
          <div class="section-break">

          <p>The next day I was surprised to remember enough of the wine tasting lady’s grating spiel to actually look up some of it. Phylloxera was the word I remembered, and it was even better as letters than as sounds. The story wasn’t nearly as interesting, but I liked the irony: louses from North America destroying the French vines, and rootstock from North America grafted onto the French vines saving the crop. America is honestly like that. We have the problems, and we have the solutions, and we’ll give you both in that order. It’s nice when history doesn’t lie to you.</p>
          <p>My desk is far enough away from the windows that I’m trapped by light from the fluorescents. That day the overheads were working with the hangover to give me a headache. They give me a headache most days. I’m twenty pounds heavier than I was in January, and my acne’s getting worse.</p>
          <p>Why anyone opened an ad agency in Philadelphia, I’ll never know. This is nothing like <span class="ital">Mad Men</span> led me to expect. Our clients are hospitals and government programs intended to curb heroin addiction. I mostly write press releases. Very little about it is glamorous, but it’s a paycheck and they didn’t require proof that I went to college. I just said I did and that was fine. I’m not sure what will happen if they find out, outside of the obvious firing—I think it’s fraud but I doubt they’d bother reporting it. Where would I ever find wine tastings after that? The horror.</p>
          <p>When I landed in Philadelphia it was becausese I had run out of motel money. I’ve never been dumb enough to spend my emergency fund at the bar, and it was the first place I put money back when when I started getting paychecks. It covered my first month’s rent, my first place away from home, and for that I owe it a life debt.</p>
          <p>The coffee shop I first worked at was only a few blocks away, but I was new to the city so I drove the car to work until the day it wouldn’t start and I just walked home. Nobody seemed bothered by this arrangement, and I never saw any parking tickets, but after a few months I had it junked. $400 for the emergency fund.</p>
          <p>The car had done its best, though, and did it well enough. It got me out of Louisiana. Down there, where the air sticks to you and even living things rot, everyone’s stuck in the same swamp. I was fourteen when I found out about my parents’ blood relationship, nothing crazy: second cousins. Their parents weren’t too far away from each other either. Of course, I already knew nobody around there had qualms about mixing sex and family; my uncle showed me that when I was six. At twenty-two I finally had enough cash squirreled away to pack my trunk full of second-hand clothing and books and drive away. Whatever genes predispose a person to leave a situation like that must be recessive or a mutation, because it clearly doesn’t run in the family.</p>
          <p>Philly suits me well enough. My rent is cheap and while my salary is low I can’t exactly complain, given the difficulty of finding work with a bogus CV and a name that doesn’t match the one on your three forms of identification. I go by Lia now, for Ophelia, and told HR it was a nickname from college that stuck.</p>
          <p>Still, six years may be long enough here for me. I’m starting to get antsy, fighting the urge to get off the Septa at 30th Street Station and hop a bus to somewhere people are curious and driven. Maybe I should buy another car—if I skip the bar twice a week I can probably scrape together a down payment in a month or two without tapping my emergency fund. Maybe I’ll try Montreal and find out whether I’m really built for the cold. My hangovers are never as bad in winter.</p>
          <p>Some grape varieties thrive in colder climates. Alex was from somewhere north, (actually) went to college in New England, and occasionally mentioned ski trips. Sometimes he didn’t zip his coat when we smoked outside in the winter. I tried to remember what he did for a living, figure out where he was that Wednesday, and maybe see if he was around that night, but I didn’t want to be needy.</p>
          <p>He wasn’t at the bar later, but I got tanked in his honor anyway.</p>

          <p>Feeling like shit every day gets old, but it has the advantage of killing, or at least obscuring, health-related anxiety. Normal changes to your body can’t bother you if you’re used to accepting the consequences of well whiskey and terrible sleep. But four weeks later, when I couldn’t keep anything down and had to go home from work at 11 am, I was a little spooked because I’d kept it lowkey the night before. Just a bottle of cheap syrah at home in service of my car savings. Usually it takes a lot to ruin my mornings like that.</p>
          <p>My periods are pretty irregular at this point, probably because I eat garbage and sleep poorly, but I was far enough out from my last one that it seemed like a good place to start. I walked down to the CVS on South Tenth and bought a home pregnancy test—it came with two in the box so you can be sure.</p>
          <p>At home, I pissed on the stick and waited. I wasn’t surprised by the result, but I was surprised by my reaction. I wanted to text Alex, but I didn’t. I knew where I might run into him.</p>
          <p>Once it became a reasonable enough hour to hit the bar, I rolled out of bed and put on some pants baggy enough to be comfortable even in my bloated state. Across the street, I pulled the lever for Camel Blues, sat down in the middle of the row, and asked for a citywide.</p>
          <div class="section-break">

          <p>Alex didn’t show up that night, but he did the next. He was already there when I arrived, held up by late meetings. It was crunchtime for a pitch in the morning and I was in a foul mood.</p>
          <p>“Hey,” he said. I didn’t say anything.</p>
          <p>“What’s wrong,” he said, and I told him I was pregnant.</p>
          <p>I’m used to feeling trapped, so I think I handle it better than others do. Alex’s eyes did about five rounds of reaction before he said anything, which took a few seconds.</p>
          <p>“How do you feel?” he asked.</p>
          <p>“I feel like shit,” I said. I always feel like shit.</p>
          <p>“About the pregnancy?” he asked.</p>
          <p>“Among other things, yes,” I said.</p>
          <p>“What do you want to do about it?” he said, and, immediately realizing what he was asking, or at least recognizing that he’d asked it for himself, quickly followed that one with “Sorry, we don’t have to talk about it.”</p>
          <p>“No, it’s okay,” I said, “we can talk about it. What do you want to do about it?”</p>
          <p>“I mean,” he said, and paused with his mouth half open trying to force the right words out, “it’s really your decision.”</p>
          <p>I could tell he wanted to ask if it was his, but I was sort of enjoying watching him squirm. This was, after all, his fault for not controlling himself. I tried to appear thoughtful and sad and beautiful so I could maybe start to enjoy the high tragedy while it was around. In truth, I knew exactly what he wanted to do about it, and I hadn’t actually slept with anyone else in months.</p>
          <p>“It’s our decision,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Well,” he said, visibly trying to slow himself down to be a Nice Guy about the situation, “there’s a Planned Parenthood in Center City. I could drive you up this weekend if you don’t want to go alone.”</p>
          <p>“I’m okay,” I said, “I don’t mind going alone.”</p>
          <p>Alex relaxed—I’d let him off the hook. I wanted to be kind this time.</p>
          <p>“I can pay for half,” he said.</p>
          <p>“That would be nice,” I said. “Thanks.”</p>
          <p>After that we drank our citywides and slept in separate houses.</p>
          <div class="section-break">

          </div>
          <p>When I went to the Planned Parenthood that Saturday with $635, the lovechild of Alex’s savings and my emergency fund, I showed up ten minutes early and waited about forty-five more. Two kids walked in holding hands and they kept their eyes down, radiating shame. A black woman in her forties sat next to me playing Candy Crush. The kids didn’t look at their phones or even talk, they just sat there.</p>
          <p>The nurse called my given name and I followed her into an examination room.</p>
          <p>It was cold and unmistakably lonely in the clinic. I didn’t mind the temperature, since it was August and I’d walked up from my house. When the doctor came in she told me I wasn’t far enough along for the really gross procedure, so I could just take a pill. That was good news. I wasn’t looking forward to the invasive, abject vacuum version. I hate stirrups.</p>
          <p>They gave me one pill there and sent me out into the sun with another in my bag. I didn’t read the label, but I was supposed to take it later. It was still early afternoon, so I walked back towards home and read a little in a coffee shop. Then I took a nap.</p>
          <p>When I woke up it was bar time. I ate a slice of pizza my roommate left in the fridge and crossed the street.</p>
          <p>Alex never comes to the bar on weekends. I think he goes out with friends or coworkers to craft beer places. Maybe he just goes to Fishtown. He’s never invited me anywhere else, and I’ve never minded being left out because I don’t see the point of spending all that money on hops and cabs, but tonight I wish he was here instead.</p>
          <p>“Happy birthday,” says the bartender as I sit down.</p>
          <p>When my drinks are in front of me I pull out the pill from my bag and read the instructions to make sure it’ll still work if I drink. Then I realize I’m not sure I want it to work.</p>
          <p>I took the first half—so I have no idea what would happen if I skip this one. Would the baby just be deformed or sick when it was born? I want a burdensome child even less than I want a healthy one, which is not at all. But for a second I wonder if the first pill is enough, and the second pill is just to force it out of me, and I realize that I’m hoping maybe what I have now is a graft. Maybe what I want is a transplant of someone else’s rootstock to heal mine, to take the swamp-rotten and foul parts of me and make them resilient and hardy. Maybe I want to hold onto a part of Alex and carry it inside. To help me survive in the cold.</p>
