Violet’s presence ghosted in after Sebastian as he crossed the threshold of his apartment, crossed toward the open door to the kitchen as he spun, and waited until his hand snapped the deadbolt into place before following him into his bedroom.

As the backpack containing clothes, laptop, books and toiletries hit the bed, Violet’s presence sank down next to it and settled in to watch its unpacking — laundry to hamper, laptop to wherever, books left in the backpack, toiletries brought to the bathroom to be left on the vanity. The hands moving each object to its semipermanent home were performing from rote, needing no input from Sebastian, having done the same thing every weekend for months. Each object had a place and its route to its spot was more or less a foregone conclusion in the single mind belonging to the hands that conveying it. Toss. Drop. Carry. A reset button had been pushed, a subroutine executed called Sunday.

The presence considered each object’s destination and debated its fitness to the object. If it came to conclusions, it didn’t announce them, having no way to do so, but Sebastian gathered the considerations into a loose set of reactions nonetheless and set them, bundled, alongside the laptop on the tangled bedspread. As his hands finished their temporary and automatic task, Sebastian flopped face-first onto his bed, rolled over, and opened his laptop without entering his password before turning his attention to the packet beside it.

Although Sebastian did not consider Violet a presence in the room, he knew she had produced the impressions he’d collected, or rather, he had the sense that the impressions he’d collected came from Violet’s reactions, even though he had no way to know that the reactions were immediate rather than theoretical, and indeed he had not considered their origin at all. In his view, he was simply idly considering the state of his bedroom and imagining how she might see it — perhaps even hoping that she would. He wanted her to be favorably impressed. He was not.

Casting an eye over spackle-patched holes left by the previous tenant, he wondered if the shabbiness and symptoms of decay evident in each feature of his furniture and environment were his fault. Some no, some yes. He could sweep, though there was no need to do that now. He could replace the lightbulb with a warmer, lower wattage, and this would cast a more favorable light on his furniture and possessions. He could not undo decades of neglect and unlicensed, disinterested renovation by the handyman who agreed to undercut a fictional lowest bidder — not without some expertise in the restoration of plaster moldings, or at least a few hundred dollars in paint and rollers. He could pick up the books off the floor.

Violet’s impressions were somewhat different. She did not have much interest in the state of the plaster moldings, and the details bordering her apartment’s walls were not in much better shape anyway. The ceiling fixture produced a light she found harsh and unfriendly, but she was imagining the room in sunlight, and so the harshness produced no effect other than to remind her of the nights she’d spent in college, up late working through a mix of anxiety and essays, more or less inured to the signals of time passing. These days she slept better and earlier, and rose earlier, so she shut off the light in her mind and replaced it with morning. In the morning the walls were softer and the unkempt bed suggested waking up, or sleeping in: a bed just vacated, a bed not yet made, rather than a bed not made at all. The books on the floor seemed juvenile, but almost charming; they at least suggested that Sebastian actually read the books that he owned. The sweeping would have to happen sooner or later.

In the parallax between Violet’s impressions of the room and Sebastian’s lay the fact of the room, and in the room lay Sebastian. Wary of losing steam, he kicked his feet off the bed and the shoes off his feet, the rank of his socks reminding him that he was totally gross, grimy with dirt and sweat, his clothes soaked through with his own body’s odors and the smoke from grills, a bonfire, and dozens of cigarettes. He remembered that he had not yet opened his window, shut against weather and break-ins from the fire escape, and unlatched it to let in the wind up from the Atlantic, grateful for the fact that the building directly south of his was downgrade along the hill and its roof therefore a story lower.

Contributing the clothes he was wearing to the hamper along with the ones he’d changed out of that morning, he grabbed a towel and walked into his bathroom, Violet’s presence following, completely unabashed at his nakedness. Sebastian started the shower and stared into the mirror for a moment.

His head was full of Violet, and her presence filtered his face’s reflection like a lens as he examined himself: pores too large, facial hair to excessive for stubble and too inconsistent to count as a beard. Teeth unappealing and yellow. Hair greasy. He was undesirable in some basic, likely unfixable ways. He took off his watch and stepped under the water. 

Violet’s presence followed him in, and overtook his awareness of himself and his surroundings as his hands resumed their automatic routines, scrubbing the weekend’s grime from his skin and hair. While they thought about the soap and water, scrub and rinse, he thought about Violet.

Although they’d met before, and in fact had distantly known each other since college, reconnected perhaps twice a year at gatherings of a certain size by interlinked groups of mutual friends, they’d never spent much time speaking beyond pleasantries and casual party observations. He knew she was a visual artist, probably some sort of collage or mixed-media thing because he never saw paint on her skin or clothes. He had never considered finding her art, or really asking about it. Now he was curious, but as with most artists who worked in media he didn’t especially understand, he mostly considered it cool that she did it at all. He had known she was cool, that being the dominant impression she produced in most people, but he had somehow not until this weekend Upstate realized that she was also warm, someone who listened and responded without being either combative or passive, and he had also somehow missed that she was wryly clever and given to understated punchlines. Never having noticed these editorializations, which apparently came out solely to amuse Violet herself, he had of course also never noticed that nobody else seemed to notice, or that this did not bother her in the slightest. Her satisfaction at amusing herself, even though most of her asides seemed funny enough to him for wider broadcast, was also satisfying vicariously — merely to be privy to a show put on and received within a single person felt like VIP access to Sebastian. Once he’d caught on, he felt that she was letting him into her private performance, but there was no way to know, because this was not the sort of theater in which the actors acknowledge the audience. But as is the case with so many actors, Violet was also dramatically beautiful despite passing in costume for an everyday person with an everyday person’s body and countenance.

Sometime on the first night this had all clicked for Sebastian, and although he was much too savvy and nowhere near drunk enough to forget tact or who he was and follow her around like a puppy that’s been given table scraps and wants more, incapable of realizing that there is no more, he spent the rest of the weekend hoping to cross her path. And indeed he had. The second night, when a contingent of them had hopped the fence surrounding the pool belonging to the American Baptist summer camp adjacent to the farm they were staying on, he had been surprised to find her among the group. His impression had always been that her well-heeled, well-mannered upbringing (because her family was very wealthy) and her collected, controlled presence (because she was impossibly cool) did not permit the sort of hooliganism he associated with himself and his friends, drunken acts of daring and benign criminalism related mostly to psychedelic drugs and light breaking-and-entering. Who had asked Violet along, or why she came, were tertiary and secondary questions for Sebastian in the moment, with the primary, hopeful, incredulous question being: is she here for me?

“I wasn’t,” said Violet’s presence, which was information Sebastian already knew, and knew when he’d first asked, but which felt good to hear straight from her unwet ghost in his shower.

So when the weekend had ended, after the third bonfire but by far the earliest, and they stood two of seven people among the last two cars to leave and Violet leaned in for a hug, it was with surprise and gratitude that he returned it, unused to the genuine warmth of her embrace, but it was with a head full of her graceful, casual, tastefully intoxicated nightswimming that he remembered it.

Now he knew it meant nothing; it was a merely polite gesture masquerading as genuine affection with such profound verisimilitude that to his unwashed heathen emotional intelligence it was indistinguishable in the moment from the item itself. 

Smarter, older now than ten hours ago, and better washed, Sebastian rotated the hot-water knob 630 degrees counterclockwise back to home, and stepped out past Violet’s presence onto the tile floor of the bathroom. He tossed the towel over his head, with Violet outside his temporary cave.

When the towel dropped to shoulder height and then below, Violet’s presence remained. She waited patiently while he paid her no mind, toweling off, and followed him back into his bedroom.

Bed-ready but wet, Sebastian sat on the edge of his bed checking his phone. Nothing was happening on it, but he dutifully investigated to see what he’d missed in his absence from the internet, enforced all weekend by intoxication of both body and spirit. He looked up Violet’s Facebook, felt guilty, and put the thing back down next to him.

“I think there was something there,” said Violet. “The spark that you felt, that now brings you embarrassment — the newness and guilt behind it didn’t show, or if they did I found it endearing. I could tell you liked me, but I knew you were trying to keep it behind the barriers of presentability, so I had to look for it there. The curtains were closed but, an actor myself, I peeked backstage.”

“I saw none of it,” said Violet.

“I saw it, but I was elsewhere; I had my hopes set on catching the eye of another man,” said Violet.

“I was just being polite, and I treated you the same as everyone else” said Violet.

Sebastian felt his eyelids heavy with the weight of two nights’ poor sleep under the overbearing brightness of the ceiling light. He looked around the room again and reexamined Violet’s notes from earlier.

The furniture, kept up poorly but functional, showed how little Sebastian cared to improve his situation. The pile of books on one side of the bed showed an absence on the other, an absence he had sought to cover up by buying furniture above the bare minimum required to replace what was missing, and by leaving town as often and for as long as possible.

The scene’s lateness and its indifferent effect on the room demonstrated that this was a nightly event, and that sleep in this room was a spell only to be invoked when absolutely necessary. What bed has unmade sheets whose owner joyfully slides beneath them?

Reluctantly, thinking of Monday, Sebastian switched off the light and laid down next to Violet’s ghost.

“But in the evening, on a Tuesday at a bar or on a Thursday at your art gallery two nights into its closing show, you’ll see me freshly, won’t you?” he asked Violet, almost in a whisper.

“I might,” she answered, “but I’m not sure.” 

“You could have spoken to others more than you spoke to me,” Sebastian said.

“I could have — maybe I did,” she answered. “I wasn’t keeping track. But I didn’t regret talking to you.”

“So then, it’s possible you’ll see me again?” 

“It is.”

“You aren’t ashamed of my apartment?”

“It’s too early to tell. In the dark, I can’t see much, and I wish I was asleep.”

“Let’s go to sleep,” Sebastian thought.

As Violet’s presence slept next to him, Sebastian let her, and lingered indulgently for a moment over her moonlit beauty, her firelit beauty, and finally over the beauty of her self-presentation. He imagined she was making a wry joke at his expense, but one meant for him to overhear, and then he imagined she was making a wry joke at his expense, but that he was this time out of earshot.

The idea that she would talk about him when he wasn’t there was almost as intoxicating as the fact that she existed in the first place, an undiscovered planet in his solar system, and he found himself unable to sleep.

“I’m going to ask you for a drink, Violet,” he said, “but I’m going to be savvy and adult about it. I’ll ask around; I’ll get a mutual referral that will offer a third-party endorsement on my behalf as they relay my phone number to you, or vice versa.”

“That sounds like a waste,” said Violet, who had only pretended to sleep.

“Wait, why?”

“I look at your room and I see nothing but sleepless nights and doubt; I see a man who thinks he’s a boy. I see a man incapable of improving his own situation, and I see that man in harsh light. I see him staying up too late, ignoring his sweeping. I am not used to unswept places. I am not used to spackle-holes. Although you think I might be used to them because I no longer live under the auspices of the wealth I was born into, I am not because I surround myself with the people whose spackle-holes are flush with the wall and painted over. I myself have spackle-holes, but mine are decorated and hidden; I make a triumph of my own failures. Your inability to do the same is what I see in your collapsed bookshelf. You read my hard-won tendency to paint over spackle-holes as an attraction to them, but what seems endearingly broken to you is just broken to me. Your charmingly unraveled self-presentation is merely a cause for pity.”

Sebastian had known Violet would say this, and resigned himself to sleep. After all, Monday morning was merely hours’ distance away, closer to him now than the last bonfire was, and closer than the moment when Violet had embraced him. He rolled to face the sea breeze; the bundle of Violet’s impressions scattered on the ground and fluttered out of order into the neglected pile of novels on the ground by the bedside table. He pretended Violet wasn’t even there. Soon sleep came, followed by sun and morning. 

Elsewhere, Violet had long been asleep, aglow with afterfact sun and the excitement of a weekend spent in the company of friends. She’d met new people, including some she’d known without knowing much about. She dreamt of a dealer’s agent showing up unannounced at her senior year art show, even though that had been years ago and the agent’s arrival hadn’t happened then or since. Around eight, she woke, showered, and left to visit her mother’s house.

When Sebastian awoke, he disabled his early alarm and waited for the next one. It rang, he showered again, and then he went to work. He remembered being grateful as he felt the airflow reverse around daybreak, finally sucking the day’s accumulated heat out the fire escape window — but it didn’t occur to him that when he’d woken up, Violet’s presence had already been gone.
