You’re in a place that is not a place—an in-between. These stories are encounters, moments of entanglement with strangers, confessions shared as two trajectories intersect. <span class="ital">Delay</span> publishes fiction that captures the strangeness of being: a shared interiority for reader and character until your glass is empty, you’ve settled your tab, and your plane is boarding.
